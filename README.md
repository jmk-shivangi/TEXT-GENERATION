# TEXT-GENERATION
Text Generation Using Markov Chains


The Markov chain was one of the first algorithms used for language generation. This model predicts the next word in the sentence by using the current word and considering the relationship between each unique word to calculate the probability of the next word. 


Example: A lot of earlier versions of the smartphone keyboard used Markov Chain to generate suggestions for the next word in the sentence.
